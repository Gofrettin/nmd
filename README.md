# nmd
set of single-header libraries for C/C++

- C89 x86 disassembler and length disassembler: [nmd_assembly.h](nmd_assembly.h)
- C89 graphics library: [nmd_graphics.h](nmd_graphics.h)
- C++ memory library for windows: [nmd_memory.hpp](nmd_memory.hpp)

**Each library's documentation is at the start of the file.**

**The end user should use the single-header libraries in the root directory.** The code in the folders(e.g. `/assembly`, `/graphics`) is for development only.

Showcase(listed in no particular order):
 - [RTTI Finder Dumper](https://github.com/theluc4s/RTTI-Finder-Dumper)
 - [CVEAC-2020](https://github.com/thesecretclub/CVEAC-2020)

I wanted to make this reposity in the same style as https://github.com/nothings/stb/ because it seemed practical.
