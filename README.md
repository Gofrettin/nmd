# nmd
set of single-header libraries for C/C++

- C89 x86 disassembler and length disassembler: [nmd_assembly.h](nmd_assembly.h)
- C++ graphics library: [nmd_graphics.hpp](nmd_graphics.hpp)
- C++ memory library for windows: [nmd_memory.hpp](nmd_memory.hpp)

**The documentation is at the start of each library(i.e. header file).**

The end user should use the single-header libraries in the current folder("nmd/").

I wanted to make this reposity in the same style as https://github.com/nothings/stb/ because it seemed practical.
