# nmd
set of single-header libraries for C/C++

- C89 x86 disassembler: [nmd_assembly.h](nmd_assembly.h)
- C89 length disassembler: [nmd_ldisasm.h](nmd_ldisasm.h)
- C++ memory library for windows: [nmd_memory.hpp](nmd_memory.hpp)
- C++ retained mode gui: [nmd_gui.hpp](nmd_gui.hpp) [not under heavy development]

**The documentation is at the start of each library(i.e. header file).**

The end user should use the single-header libraries in the current folder("nmd/").

I wanted to make this reposity in the same style as https://github.com/nothings/stb/ because it seemed practical.
